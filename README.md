#Overview
This element will tile its immediate children in an evenly spaced grid,
attempting to size the children to prevent any scrolling.

This was designed to work with tiles containing video, so works by force
constraining the width as videos height is derived from the aspect
ratio.

#Usage
`./ui-grid-tiler.html` is a fully built and vulcanized Polymer
component.
